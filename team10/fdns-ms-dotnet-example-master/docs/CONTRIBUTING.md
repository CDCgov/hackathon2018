## Report bugs using issues
We use Issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by opening a new issue; it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code
[This is an example](http://stackoverflow.com/q/12488905/180626) of a good bug report. Here's [another example from Craig Hockenberry](http://www.openradar.me/11905408).

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific
  - Give sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)
